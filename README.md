# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

- Use expo-router with TS
- Uses bare workflow to enable expo dev build
- Uses Tamagui for Theme
- Uses biome for code formatting
- Whenever possible prefer Tamagui Lucide Icons instead of expo vector icons
- ~~Its a monorepo~~ (Its not) 
  - Follow [this](https://tamagui.dev/docs/guides/metro#native) to add metro monorepo support (Didnt work for me though)
- The Optimizing compiler is only enabled for expo. There is no web support for optimizing compiler. Follow [Web Support section here](https://tamagui.dev/docs/guides/metro#native) to add it

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
